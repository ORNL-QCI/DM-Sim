## About DM_Sim

In this repository you will find a CUDA implementation for simulating quantum circuit on single-GPU, single-node-multi-GPUs such as NVIDIA DGX-1/2, and multi-nodes GPU cluster like ORNL Summit supercomputer using full density operators. Our DM_sim simulator fully supports [OpenQASM](https://github.com/Qiskit/openqasm) language (see [spec](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.03429.pdf). OpenQASM can be generated by Qiskit, Cirq, ProjectQ and Scaffold. For scale-up (single-node-multi-GPUs), we leverage fast intra-node interconnects such as NVLink, NV-SLI and NVSwitch, see our [benchmarking](https://drive.google.com/open?id=13S4zbl4asHlWv_oebHw1YOWkzDr6I9wg) paper and [evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.04611) paper for detail. This simulator is based on MG-BSP model, please see our paper for details.

## More Benchmarks
We have developed an OpenQASM based benchmark suite called "[QASMBench](https://github.com/uuudown/QASMBench)" which provides more real quantum circuit benchmarks. Please see [QASMBench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.13018) paper for details.

### OpenQASM

OpenQASM (Open Quantum Assembly Language) is a low-level quantum intermediate representation (IR) for quantum instructions, similar to the traditional *Hardware-Description-Language* (HDL) like Verilog and VHDL. OpenQASM is the open-source unified low-level assembly language for IBM quantum machines publically available on cloud that have been investigated and verified by many existing research works. Several popular quantum software frameworks use OpenQASM as one of their output-formats, including [Qiskit](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit), [Cirq](https://github.com/quantumlib/cirq), [Scaffold](https://github.com/epiqc/ScaffCC), [ProjectQ](https://github.com/ProjectQ-Framework/ProjectQ), etc.

#### Qiskit
The *Quantum Information Software Kit* ([Qiskit](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit)) is a quantum software developed by *IBM*. It is based on Python. OpenQASM can be generated from Qiskit via:
```text
QuantumCircuit.qasm()
```

#### Cirq
[Cirq](https://github.com/quantumlib/cirq) is a quantum software framework from *Google*. OpenQASM can be generated from Cirq (not fully compatible) via:
```text
cirq.Circuit.to_qasm()
```

#### Scaffold
[Scaffold](https://github.com/epiqc/ScaffCC) is a quantum programming language embedded in the C/C++ programming language based on the [LLVM](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project) compiler toolchain. A Scaffold program can be compiled by [Scaffcc](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.01902.pdf) to OpenQASM via "**-b**" compiler option.

#### ProjectQ
[ProjectQ](https://github.com/ProjectQ-Framework/ProjectQ) is a quantum software platform developed by *Steiger et al.* from ETH Zurich. The official website is [here](https://projectq.ch/). ProjectQ can generate OpenQASM when using IBM quantum machines as the backends:
```text
IBMBackend.get_qasm()
```
